# Android App Generation Guide

## üéØ Step 4: Generate Android App with Bubblewrap

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ
- [x] PWA deployed to Vercel (or other hosting)
- [x] Bubblewrap CLI installed
- [x] Android Studio installed (optional but recommended)
- [x] Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### 1. Initialize Android Project

Once you have your deployed URL (e.g., `https://relationbooster-xxx.vercel.app`), run:

```bash
# Initialize Bubblewrap project
bubblewrap init --manifest https://your-deployed-url.vercel.app/manifest.json

# Follow the prompts:
# - Package ID: com.yourcompany.relationbooster
# - App name: RelationBooster
# - Launcher name: RelationBooster
# - Theme color: #7c3aed
# - Background color: #1e1b4b
# - Start URL: /
# - Display mode: fullscreen
# - Orientation: portrait
```

### 2. Configure App Details

Bubblewrap will create a `twa-manifest.json` file. Update it with proper details:

```json
{
  "packageId": "com.yourcompany.relationbooster",
  "host": "your-deployed-url.vercel.app",
  "name": "RelationBooster",
  "launcherName": "RelationBooster",
  "display": "fullscreen",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "themeColor": "#7c3aed",
  "backgroundColor": "#1e1b4b",
  "startUrl": "/",
  "iconUrl": "https://your-deployed-url.vercel.app/icons/icon-512x512.png",
  "maskableIconUrl": "https://your-deployed-url.vercel.app/icons/icon-512x512.png",
  "shortcuts": [],
  "enableSiteSettingsShortcut": true,
  "isChromeOSOnly": false,
  "includeNotificationDelegation": false
}
```

### 3. Build the Android App

```bash
# Build debug APK for testing
bubblewrap build

# Build release APK for Play Store
bubblewrap build --release
```

### 4. Sign the APK for Play Store

You'll need to create a keystore for app signing:

```bash
# Generate keystore (run this once)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore relationbooster-release-key.keystore -alias relationbooster -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Follow prompts to set password and details
```

### 5. Configure Signing in Bubblewrap

Edit `twa-manifest.json` to include signing configuration:

```json
{
  // ... other config
  "signingKey": {
    "path": "./relationbooster-release-key.keystore",
    "alias": "relationbooster"
  }
}
```

### 6. Build Signed Release APK

```bash
# Build signed release APK
bubblewrap build --release

# APK will be generated at: ./app-release-unsigned.apk
```
