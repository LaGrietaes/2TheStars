# GitHub Setup & Netlify Integration Guide

## 🎯 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click "New Repository"** (green button)
3. **Repository Details:**
   - Repository name: `2thestars` (or `2thestars-pwa`)
   - Description: `PWA relationship enhancer with 60 positions - Google Play ready`
   - Set to **Public** (required for free Netlify)
   - ✅ **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - ✅ **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
   - ✅ **DO NOT** add license yet

4. **Click "Create Repository"**

## 🚀 Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

Copy the commands GitHub shows you, or use these:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/2thestars.git

# Set main branch (modern GitHub default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔗 Step 3: Connect Netlify to GitHub

### Option A: Automatic GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and sign in
2. **Click "Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
3. **Choose "Deploy with GitHub"**
4. **Authorize Netlify** to access your GitHub repositories
5. **Select your repository:** `2thestars`
6. **Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`
   - Node version: `18`
7. **Click "Deploy site"**

### Build Settings in Netlify:
```
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: out
Node version: 18.x
```

## 🌐 Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom domain instead of `random-name.netlify.app`:

1. **In Netlify Dashboard** → **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. **Click "Add custom domain"**
3. **Enter your domain** (e.g., `2thestars.com`)
4. **Follow DNS configuration** instructions

## 🎯 Step 5: Update URLs

Once Netlify gives you your URL (e.g., `https://amazing-stars-123.netlify.app`):

1. **Update README.md** with your actual Netlify URL
2. **Update APK generation commands** with your URL
3. **Commit and push** the changes

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update URLs with production Netlify deployment"
git push
```

## 🔄 Step 6: Automatic Deployments

Now you have automatic deployments! Every time you:
- Push to the `main` branch
- Netlify automatically builds and deploys
- Your live site updates in ~2 minutes

## 📱 Step 7: Generate APK

Once your site is live:

```bash
# Install Bubblewrap globally
npm install -g @bubblewrap/cli

# Generate APK using your live URL
bubblewrap init --manifest https://YOUR_NETLIFY_URL/manifest.json

# Build the APK
bubblewrap build --release
```

## 🎉 Success Checklist

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Netlify?
